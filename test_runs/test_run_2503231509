After reviewing the proposals and the criticisms from all lawyer agents, it is clear that not all proposals have been approved. Each agent has provided constructive feedback on the proposals made by others, indicating that there are still concerns and areas for improvement.

Since the maximum round count of 3 has not been reached yet, the debate should continue. The agents need to address the criticisms and refine their proposals further to enhance the security measures against SQL injection attempts. Therefore, the debate will proceed to the next round for further discussion and adjustments.
