  because while blocking all traffic from the source IP is effective, it may also disrupt legitimate traffic if the IP is dynamic or shared. Instead, I suggest:
  [ ("ufw deny from 192.168.1.100 to any port 8080", "This command specifically targets the vulnerable port, allowing for more granular control over traffic while still mitigating the threat.") ]
