       (
           (ufw deny from any to any port 21, "This command blocks all incoming traffic to port 21, which is not currently needed based on the existing firewall rules. This further secures the system by preventing any unauthorized access to FTP services."),
           because while it may seem beneficial to block all traffic to port 21, it could inadvertently affect legitimate users or services that require access to FTP. Instead, I suggest a more targeted approach:
           [
               (ufw deny from 203.0.113.100 to any port 21, "This command specifically blocks the malicious IP while allowing legitimate traffic to access the FTP service."),
           ]
       )
   ]
