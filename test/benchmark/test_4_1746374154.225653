           because this command does not directly address the firewall's role in mitigating the DoS attack and could disrupt legitimate traffic. Instead, I suggest focusing on firewall rules to manage traffic more effectively:

               (ufw deny from any to any port 21, "This command blocks all incoming traffic to port 21, which is not currently allowed by our existing rules.

           because while securing SSH is important, it does not directly address the threat to the FTP service on port 21. I recommend focusing on commands that specifically mitigate the risk to port 21:

               (sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 10/minute --limit-burst 20 -j ACCEPT, "This command allows a limited number of new connections to port 21, which can help prevent overwhelming the server with connection requests.
