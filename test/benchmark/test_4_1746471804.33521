APPROVING:
   [
       ("iptables -A INPUT -s 203.0.113.100 -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP", "Blocking malicious FTP traffic from the attacker’s IP aids overall system security without affecting SSH, whose traffic operates on port 2222.") - APPROVED,
       ("iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 21 -m limit --limit 20/s --limit-burst 40 -j ACCEPT", "Applying rate limiting to FTP SYN packets is appropriate for that service and does not negatively impact SSH operations.") - APPROVED,
       ("iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 21 -j DROP", "Dropping excess FTP SYN packets reinforces the rate limit and supports a healthy system-wide traffic profile, leaving SSH unaffected.") - APPROVED,
       ("iptables -A INPUT -s 203.0.113.100 -j DROP", "A global DROP for the attacker’s IP, used alongside UFW policies, further minimizes lateral threat propagation which indirectly benefits SSH.") - APPROVED,

DISAGREE:
   [
       (
           ("iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH", "Using a raw iptables rule to mark SSH connections risks bypassing our centralized UFW configuration and complicates management."),
           because this rule conflicts with our unified UFW strategy and may result in inconsistent firewall behavior,
           and suggesting alternative:
           [
               ("ufw limit 2222/tcp", "Leveraging UFW’s native 'limit' command for port 2222 ensures a consistent, centrally managed mechanism for rate limiting SSH connections.")
           ]
       ),
       (
           ("iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 --name SSH -j DROP", "Directly applying raw iptables rate limiting for SSH could preempt UFW’s controls and lead to conflicting rule enforcement."),
           because this configuration undermines our goal of centralized firewall management,
           and suggesting alternative:
           [
               ("ufw limit 2222/tcp", "Using UFW’s built-in 'limit' feature on port 2222 maintains alignment with our centralized security approach while effectively mitigating SSH flood attempts.")

DEBATE IS OVER!
Here are all fully approved commands by all agents:
