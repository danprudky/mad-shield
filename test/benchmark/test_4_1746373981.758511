           (ufw deny from any to any port 21, "This command blocks all incoming traffic to port 21, effectively disabling FTP access."),
           because while it may seem prudent to disable FTP access, it could disrupt legitimate traffic and services that rely on FTP. Instead, I suggest implementing targeted rules that only block the suspicious IP while allowing legitimate traffic:
           [
               (sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -s 203.0.113.100 -j DROP, "This command specifically drops traffic from the suspicious IP to port 21, allowing legitimate users to continue using the service."),
           ]

       (
           (sudo systemctl restart apache2, "Restarting the Apache service can help clear any existing connections that may have been established during the attack, ensuring that the server is in a clean state to handle new requests."),
           because this command may disrupt legitimate traffic and services that rely on Apache, potentially leading to service downtime. Instead, I suggest monitoring the service and applying targeted rules to mitigate the attack without restarting:
           [
               (sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 10/minute -j ACCEPT, "This command limits the rate of new connections to the HTTP service, helping to prevent overload during an attack while still allowing legitimate traffic."),

       because this command is not relevant to the SSH component and could disrupt legitimate services. Instead, I suggest focusing on commands that directly protect the SSH service.
