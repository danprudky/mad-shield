       (
           (systemctl restart named, "This command restarts the DNS service (assuming it's using BIND) to ensure that any potential issues caused by the attack are cleared and the service is running fresh."),
           because this command may not be necessary if the DNS service is not directly affected by the current attack. Instead, I suggest focusing on commands that enhance the firewall's rules to block the attack more effectively:
           [
               (iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -m state --state INVALID -j DROP, "This command drops any invalid packets targeting the DNS port (53), which helps to prevent malformed packets that could exploit vulnerabilities in the DNS service."),
