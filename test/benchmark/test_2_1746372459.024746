       (server_lawyer, sudo systemctl restart apache2, "Restarting the Apache service can help clear any potential hanging connections or processes that may have been affected by the attack, ensuring that the server is in a clean state."),
       because this command does not directly address the firewall's role in mitigating the attack and could disrupt legitimate traffic. Instead, I suggest focusing on firewall rules to block the attack:
       [
           (ufw deny 21/tcp, "This command blocks all incoming traffic to port 21, which is being targeted in the DoS SYN packet flood, ensuring that the service is not vulnerable to exploitation."),

       because while securing SSH is important, it does not directly address the current threat targeting port 21 and could lead to confusion in prioritizing defenses. Instead, we should focus on commands that specifically mitigate the DoS threat on port 21.
