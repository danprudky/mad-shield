Alert 203.0.113.100_TCP_5_to_server loaded

I'm firewall_lawyer and suggesting these proposals:
   [
       (ufw deny from 203.0.113.100 to any port 21 comment 'Block potential DOS attack from suspicious IP'), 
       (ufw limit ssh comment 'Limit SSH connections to prevent brute force attacks'),
       (ufw deny proto tcp from any to any port 21 comment 'Deny all incoming connections to FTP port to mitigate DOS risk'),
       (ufw logging on comment 'Enable logging to monitor and analyze incoming traffic for suspicious activity')
   ]

**Justifications:**

1. **Block potential DOS attack from suspicious IP**: By denying traffic from the specific source IP (203.0.113.100) to port 21, we can immediately mitigate the risk of a DOS attack targeting the FTP service. This command helps to prevent further attempts from this IP, which has been flagged as a potential threat.

2. **Limit SSH connections to prevent brute force attacks**: Implementing a limit on SSH connections helps to protect against brute force attacks, which can be a common method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access. This command allows a certain number of connection attempts from a single IP within a specified time frame, thus reducing the risk of successful attacks.

3. **Deny all incoming connections to FTP port to mitigate DOS risk**: Since the alert indicates a potential DOS attack on port 21 (FTP), denying all incoming connections to this port will help to prevent any further exploitation of this service. This is a proactive measure to ensure that the firewall component is not vulnerable to DOS attacks through FTP.

4. **Enable logging to monitor and analyze incoming traffic for suspicious activity**: By enabling logging, we can keep track of all incoming traffic and identify patterns or repeated attempts from malicious sources. This information is crucial for ongoing security assessments and for making informed decisions about future firewall rules.
