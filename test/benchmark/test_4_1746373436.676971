MY UPDATED:

       (sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT, "This command allows incoming SSH connections only on the specified port (2222), ensuring that only legitimate traffic is processed while blocking other ports that may be targeted by the attack.") - updated to emphasize the importance of addressing the current threat while maintaining SSH access.

APPROVING:
   [
       (sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP, "This command drops all incoming traffic to port 21, effectively mitigating the risk of the attack affecting the server until further analysis can be conducted.") - APPROVED

DISAGREE:
   [
       (
           (server_lawyer, sudo systemctl restart apache2, "Restarting the Apache service can help clear any existing connections that may be part of the attack, ensuring that the server is in a clean state to handle legitimate traffic."),
           because this command is not relevant to the SSH component and could disrupt services unrelated to the current threat. Instead, I suggest focusing on commands that directly protect the SSH service.
           [
               (ufw logging on, "Enabling logging will help monitor and analyze incoming traffic patterns, allowing for better detection of potential threats and attacks in real-time.")
