I'm firewall_lawyer and suggesting these proposals:
   [
       ("ufw deny from 203.0.113.100 comment 'Block suspected attacker for potential DOS on FTP port'", "This command explicitly blocks all traffic from the source IP 203.0.113.100, which is associated with the suspicious FTP SYN flood alert, reducing the risk of further abuse from that origin."),

       ("ufw logging on", "Enabling UFW logging provides visibility into dropped and allowed connection attempts, allowing us to monitor and respond to any further suspicious activity in real time.")
   ]

I'm server_lawyer and suggesting these proposals:

       ("iptables -I INPUT 1 -s 203.0.113.100 -j LOG --log-prefix 'DOS_ATTACK: '", "Immediately log any further packets from the suspicious IP for forensic analysis, helping to monitor any recurring attack attempts."),

I'm dns_lawyer and suggesting these proposals:
   [
       ("iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 203.0.113.100 --dport 21 -j DROP", "Immediately drop any TCP packets from the suspicious IP on port 21 to prevent further DOS impact on the server’s resources—even if our DNS service isn’t directly served on FTP, unwanted traffic can overload the host."),

   ]

Justification:
Although our DNS component primarily serves on port 53, an influx of extraneous traffic—even on seemingly unrelated ports such as 21—can overload system resources and potentially destabilize services. By isolating and blocking the source IP specifically targeting FTP, we help maintain system-wide resource availability and interrupt the DOS vector. These CLI commands are designed to be integrated into our overall firewall configuration to ensure robust and coordinated defense across the system.
