           because this command may disrupt legitimate traffic and does not directly address the ongoing threat from the suspicious IP. Instead, I suggest focusing on blocking the malicious traffic and implementing rate limiting:
           [
               (ufw limit 21/tcp, "This command limits the number of incoming connections to port 21, which can help mitigate the risk of a SYN flood attack without disrupting existing connections.")

           because while it may prevent the attack, it could disrupt legitimate traffic if FTP is needed for operations. Instead, we should focus on targeted blocking of the malicious IP and rate limiting.
           suggesting alternative:
