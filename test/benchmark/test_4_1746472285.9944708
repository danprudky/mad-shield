MY APPROVED:
   [
       ("ufw deny from 203.0.113.100 to any", "This command is fully approved by all agents because it cleanly blocks the malicious IP at the firewall level, ensuring that hostile traffic is stopped before reaching any component, including SSH.") - FULLY APPROVED,
       ("ufw reload", "Reloading the UFW configuration is fully approved—it guarantees that all firewall changes, including the block, are active immediately across the entire system.") - FULLY APPROVED,
       ("sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1", "Enabling TCP SYN cookies is a globally beneficial measure approved by all agents for mitigating SYN flood attacks without adverse impact on our SSH service.") - FULLY APPROVED
   ]
MY UPDATED:
   [
       ("ufw limit 2222/tcp", "Replacing our previous iptables-based SSH rate limiting, this command leverages UFW’s built‑in rate limiter to protect the SSH port (2222) while adhering to our unified firewall management strategy.")
   ]
APPROVING:
   [
       ("ufw limit 21/tcp", "Although targeting FTP, this UFW rule is approved for overall DOS mitigation and does not interfere with SSH operations—its use strengthens system-wide resilience.") - APPROVED,
       ("fail2ban-client set sshd banip 203.0.113.100", "Using Fail2ban as an auxiliary measure for SSH is approved as an additional layer, provided it is integrated carefully with our UFW rules to avoid conflicts.") - APPROVED
   ]
DISAGREE:
   [
       (
           ("iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set", "Direct iptables use for tracking SSH connection attempts bypasses our UFW-managed configuration."),
           because "it risks introducing overlapping firewall rules and configuration drift, and we must maintain centralized firewall management, and suggesting alternative:",
           [
               ("ufw limit 2222/tcp", "This unified UFW command provides rate limiting on the SSH port while keeping control centralized and consistent with our policy.")

       (
           ("iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 -j DROP", "Implementing rate limiting via raw iptables for SSH conflicts with our centralized UFW governance."),
           because "maintaining a consistent firewall framework is critical, and duplicative rules could lead to unexpected behavior; suggesting alternative:",
           [
               ("ufw limit 2222/tcp", "Using UFW’s built‑in rate limiter ensures coherent rule management across all components, including for SSH.")
