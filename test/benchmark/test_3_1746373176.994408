           because this command is overly broad and could disrupt legitimate traffic to port 21, which may be necessary for authorized users. Instead, I suggest a more targeted approach:

           because this command is not relevant to the netplan component and could disrupt services unrelated to the current threat. Instead, I suggest focusing on commands that directly protect the network configuration.
